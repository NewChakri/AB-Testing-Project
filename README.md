# AB_Testing_Project

Developed a Python-based A/B Testing tool that automates the statistical analysis of two groups to determine significant differences in metrics. The project includes a user-friendly Streamlit interface for easy interaction and visualization of results. Implemented statistical tests such as Independent Samples t Test and Mann-Whitney U Test to accommodate different data distributions and variance conditions.
